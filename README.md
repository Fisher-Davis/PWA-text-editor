## Summary 
After running `npm i` and `npm start`, you are presented with a website that allows you to type in the body of the page. There is an install button that will install the application to your local machine and allow offline use. 
It also saves the body into a database to then be pulled out for later use. 

## Usage
This application is used to make text files and these files can be saved to the local machine. You can install the app directly to the desktop and can be accessed by clicking on the app.
